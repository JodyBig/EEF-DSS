  	  <h1>Question: When are you planting?</h1>
  	  <h2>Rationale statement:</h2>
		  <p>With fertilisation at planting the timing of planting affects the timing relative to the wet season and
		  	 its associated risk of higher N loss. For an early planted and fertilised crop,
		  	 the NI is unlikely to still work by the time this risk of N loss increases,
		  	 hence a slow releasing CRF is likely to give more benefit.</a>

		  <h2>Temporary notes:</h2>
		  <i>
		    <h3>For discussion:</h3>
		    <p>reduced longevity of NI with late application, but this may only be affecting late ratoon crops which experience the hotter weather, not late plant crops. <mark>To be checked with modelling â€“ abstract analysis for given temperature responses how the the length of inhibition changes at different times of the year?</mark></p>
