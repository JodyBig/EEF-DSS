				<h1>Is your soil a light or heavy soil?</h1>
				<h2>Rationale statement:</h2>
				<p>There are some suggestions that NI are better suited to reducing denitrification losses and CRF better
					suited to reducing leaching losses. This hypothesis is still being tested further.
					If correct it means NI are less likely to provide benefits on well drained soils.
					Note, this question may be refined later on the basis of groups of soil types (e.g. local 6ES classification),
				based on simulation scenarios.</a>

				<h2>Evidence:</h2>
