  	<h1>Question: Are you applying all N fertiliser at planting time (e.g. Mound planting)?</h1>
  	<h2>Rationale statement:</h2>
		<p>Application at planting time increases the risk of N loss due to being well ahead of the peak N uptake time.</a>
  	<br/>
  	<h2>Evidence:</h2>

		<h2>Temporary notes:</h2>
		<i>
		  <h3>For discussion:</h3>
		  <ul>
			  <li>
				  Anything else specific about mound planting? Is it only used on some soils?
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Is this question (and part of the tree) for plant crops or only plant crops mound planted?
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  Some other plant crops are currently not captured (non-mound, or where fertiliser is not applied at planting (May-Aug option not included in other side of the tree)
			  </li>
			  <li>
			  Plant crops typically show much less effectiveness of EEF due to the reduced N response which stems from the typically higher mineral N at planting. Should there be a decision point that considers the amount of planting N (or fallow conditions) and gives option to stick with urea? <mark>That said, EEF may still reduce N loss even if it isn't affecting yield - CHECK using Jody's tableau tool but for plant crops.</mark>
