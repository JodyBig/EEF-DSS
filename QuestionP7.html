				<h1>When are you planting?</h1>
				<h2>Rationale statement:</h2>
				<p>With fertilisation at planting the timing of planting affects the timing relative to the wet season and
					its associated risk of higher N loss. For an early planted and fertilised crop,
					the NI is unlikely to still work by the time this risk of N loss increases,
				hence a slow releasing CRF is likely to give more benefit.</a>
				<br/>
				<h2>Evidence:</h2>
				<!-- <h2>Temporary notes:</h2>
				<i>
				<h3>For discussion:</h3>
				<p>reduced longevity of NI with late application, but this may only be affecting late ratoon crops which experience the hotter weather, not late plant crops. <mark>To be checked with modelling â€“ abstract analysis for given temperature responses how the the length of inhibition changes at different times of the year?</mark>
