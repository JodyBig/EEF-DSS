  	  <h1>Question: When will your crops be harvested?</h1>
  	  <h2>Rationale statement:</h2>
		  <p>With early harvested crops there is a concern that CCS may be reduced if the fertiliser N is released late from CRF. This hypothesis is still to be verified.</a>
  	  <br/>
  	  <h2>Evidence:</h2>

		  <h2>Temporary notes:</h2>
		  <i>
		  	<h3>For discussion:</h3>
		  	<p>Other possible considerations: Due to temperature effects on NI, the longevity of NI may be reduced for late fertiliser applications in hot weather. <mark>If confirmed</mark> this may affect its relative benefits to CRF. There have also been experiments that have suggested increased loss of N from late CRF due to release coinciding with wet period. <mark>If confirmed</mark> his may affect its relative benefits to NI.</p>
