				<h1>When will your crops be harvested?</h1>
				<h2>Rationale statement:</h2>
				<p>With early harvested crops there is a concern that CCS may be reduced if the fertiliser N is released late from CRF. This hypothesis is still to be verified.</a>
				<br/>
				<h2>Evidence:</h2>
				<!--		  <h2>Temporary notes:</h2>
				<i>
				<h3>For discussion:</h3>
				<p>Other possible considerations: Due to temperature effects on NI, the longevity of NI may be reduced for late fertiliser applications in hot weather. <mark>If confirmed</mark> this may affect its relative benefits to CRF. There have also been experiments that have suggested increased loss of N from late CRF due to release coinciding with wet period. <mark>If confirmed</mark> his may affect its relative benefits to NI.</p>
