  	<h1>Question: Do you need to apply N fertiliser products above ground?</h1>
  	<h2>Rationale statement:</h2>
		<p>Surface applied fertiliser products that are subject to rapid hydrolysis of a large amount of urea (e.g. a single application of urea or urea with NI) have a higher risk of NH3 volatilisation loss. NI may exacerbate NH3 volatilisation. CRF controls release of urea and hence reduces the rate of NH4 production and the accompanying increase in pH limiting NH3 volatilisation loss. Use of NH4SO4 avoids the increase in pH and reduces risk of NH3 volatilisation. Use of a urease inhibitor may also reduce risk. </a>
