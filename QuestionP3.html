				<h1>Are you applying all N fertiliser at planting time (e.g. Mound planting)?</h1>
				<h2>Rationale statement:</h2>
				<p>Application at planting time increases the risk of N loss due to being well ahead of the peak N uptake time.</a>
				<br/>
				<h2>Evidence:</h2>
				<!-- <h2>Temporary notes:</h2>
				<i>
				<h3>For discussion:</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>
				Anything else specific about mound planting? Is it only used on some soils?
				</li>
				<li>
				Is this question (and part of the tree) for plant crops or only plant crops mound planted?
				</li>
				<li>
				Some other plant crops are currently not captured (non-mound, or where fertiliser is not applied at planting (May-Aug option not included in other side of the tree)
				</li>
				<li>
				Plant crops typically show much less effectiveness of EEF due to the reduced N response which stems from the typically higher mineral N at planting. Should there be a decision point that considers the amount of planting N (or fallow conditions) and gives option to stick with urea? <mark>That said, EEF may still reduce N loss even if it isn't affecting yield - CHECK using Jody's tableau tool but for plant crops.</mark>
